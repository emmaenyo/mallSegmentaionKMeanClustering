To facilitate easier processing and improve readability during model training, mapping numerical labels to their corresponding string representations using a predefined dictionary was necessary. This step was essential for maintaining clarity and consistency across the dataset. For instance, numerical labels were converted as follows:

- <b> B-NAME_STUDENT.</b>
- <b> I-NAME_STUDENT.</b>


<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<b> As the  PII detection models continue to be refine, commitments to safeguarding student privacy remains unwavering. The journey ahead is promising, and dedication to advancing these tools to ensure educational data serves its purpose ethically and responsibly.</b>
